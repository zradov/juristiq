        TASK: Review this contract clause for compliance.

        CLAUSE TYPE: {clause_type}
        CONTRACT EXCERPT: {contract_excerpt}
        POLICY TEXT: {policy_text}

        FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES:

        Example 1 (party name missing corporate suffix):
        Review Label: Risky
        Suggested Redline: Replace "Adams Golf" with "Adams Golf, Ltd." wherever referenced; include registered entity full name in signature block.
        Rationale: Contract omits corporate suffix; registered legal name must be used.

        Example 2 (names consistent):
        Review Label: Compliant
        Suggested Redline: N/A
        Rationale: Parties' legal names match Secretary of State records.

        Example 3 (no governing law clause present):
        Review Label: Missing
        Suggested Redline: Insert clause: "This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware."
        Rationale: No governing law clause is present; policy requires jurisdiction.

        Example 4 (clause incomplete with TBD):
        Review Label: Lack of required data
        Suggested Redline: N/A
        Rationale: Clause contains placeholder "TBD date"; required information missing.
